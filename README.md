# Goal Tracker
**Code name:** Project Atlas

A web platform that helps people organize personal and professional goals by breaking down big objectives into small steps, tracking real progress, and encouraging continuous reflection.

This project was born from a real personal pain: the difficulty of defining goals and creating a realistic, efficient path to achieve them.
